        Creativity is a muscle, not a specified skillset, and an adept copywriter flexes that muscle
        to seamlessly meet the needs of a brand or client. In my work, I have had to write
        compelling copy for the everyday brands of American flash-sale retailer Zulily to the luxury
        brands of the renowned London department store Harrods and everything in between. Use the
        categories below to explore facets of my previous work that might correspond to the tone of
        voice that youâ€™re looking for.
