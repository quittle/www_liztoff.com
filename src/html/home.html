        In my years of copywriting, one thing has become abundantly clear to me: creativity is a
        muscle, not a specified skillset, and an adept copywriter can flex their creativity to
        seamlessly meet the needs of a brand, client, or project. I have had to write compelling
        copy for the everyday brands of American flash-sale retailer Zulily, the luxury brands of
        the renowned London department store Harrods and everything in between and no matter my
        prior experience with the subject matter, I have found a way to create something compelling
        for my audience.
