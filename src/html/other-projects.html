    <h1>Other Projects</h1>

    <p>
        In addition to my love of writing, I am passionate about resource sharing and collaboration.
        Explore below the resources I’ve created to aid my team members and to insist on a quality
        of work for not just myself but for those around me.

            <h3>Punctuation Guide</h3>
            Working with others from varied professional backgrounds and experience levels, it
            became clear that it would be helpful to have a resource that not only explains the ways
            in which punctuation should effectively be employed, but one that also used examples
            specific to our work.

            <h3>Dangling Modifiers</h3>
            Dangling modifiers are a grammatical pitfall that can have both novice and experienced
            writers scratching their heads at the best of times and confusing their readers at the
            worst. After needing to train each of the junior copywriters I mentored about this very
            subject, I decided it would be beneficial to have a resource that senior copywriters and
            juniors alike could turn to to explain, learn and grow as writers. I also led an
            accompanying workshop for all 20 juniors.

            <h3>Problematic Narratives</h3>
            As the voice of a brand, copywriters have dual core responsibilities: firstly, to
            represent brands in a positive, authentic light and secondly, to ensure all readers
            enjoy their experience interacting with your platform and message. As individuals,
            however, it can be a challenge to see past your own perspective and experiences and
            identify potential missteps that may present themselves in addressing a diverse
            audience. It was of the utmost importance to me that my fellow writers have the
            resources and platform to show a commitment to avoiding problematic words and
            narratives.

            <h3>Role Training Documents</h3>
            Though I’ve not been able to include them here due to company privacy concerns, I
            created training documents for each role that I held at Zulily (five in total). These
            documents detailed the responsibilities of the role, glossaries of need-to-know terms,
            how the work is done using the various internal systems and a breakdown of what an
            average day looked like in that position. The goal of these docs was to ensure that
            everyone who held the role would have everything that they would need to be successful
            right from the start and that less knowledge would be lost at what is a high-turnover
            company.
