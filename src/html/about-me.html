    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h3>In the workplace</h3>
    <p>
        I’m known for my boundless creativity, approaching everything I do with a fresh perspective
        while seamlessly adapting to varied customers and brand voices and incorporating SEO
        keywords. I pride myself on making an impact on every team I am a part of, not just with my
        writing but also through process improvement, training document and workshop creation and
        interdepartmental partnerships. I cherish the meaningful, lasting relationships that I have
        built with the people that I’ve worked alongside at every step of my career.
    </p>

    <h3>Outside of the workplace</h3>
    <p>
        In my free time, you can find me road tripping with my other half, skipping off to the
        theatre, and drawing Harry Potter characters as dogs.
