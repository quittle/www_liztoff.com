            <h2>AXEL ARIGATO</h2>
            <p>
                Axel Arigato was launched with one core goal: to embrace the now while always
                searching for the tomorrow. Founders Max Svärda and Albin Johansson made their mark
                on the industry by questioning its entire structure and reinventing it to deliver
                couture-quality footwear at an affordable price tag. Expanding to include
                accessories and streetwear staples, the brand forgoes the typical seasonal
                collections and traditional sales channels in lieu of engaging with customers
                directly and releasing a new style every week. The Axel Arigato world is made up of
                references to music, art and architecture illustrated and channelled through its own
                unique, disruptive and counter-cultural voice. The result is easy-to-wear designs
                that are graphic, editorial and subtle.

                Jo Malone London weaves stories of British landscapes in perfumery. From the
                dramatic cliffs of Dover to the picturesque Cotswolds, its fragrances demonstrate a
                singular dedication to the label’s heritage and the endless fount of inspiration
                that it provides. English Pear &amp; Freesia, for example, mirrors the golden spell
                that falls over the countryside in autumn, while the Amber &amp; Lavender cologne
                evokes the cosmopolitan gardens of the capital.

                found gracing both wool and silk scarves, is among the most sought-after designs of
                the brand, while reimaginings of the Web stripe and pops of florals delight season

            <p>
                Christmas trees just aren’t complete until they’ve been crowned with a tree topper.
                The tradition captured merrymakers’ imaginations in the mid-1800s when an
                illustration of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the royal family gathered around
                their angel-topped Christmas tree appeared in the Illustrated London News. Angel and
                star designs have since been favoured for their connection to the Nativity, while
                glass renditions are perfect for finishing off contemporary firs.

                from fruit to bottle, exemplifying the excellence of the label’s three Californian
                vineyards: Tench, Sugarloaf Mountain and Edcora. The unique elevations, climates and
                soils of each works a near-alchemical magic upon their native grapes to create wines
                marked by intense flavours, sumptuous textures and fully realised personalities. It
                is in this way that the collective of successful entrepreneurs and gifted
                professionals at PerUs translates its central philosophy: an enriched life is
                measured not in possessions, but in the vibrant experiences shared with friends and
                family.

                is equally suited to social tipples as it is to intimate fireside sipping. Enjoy it
                as a multi-layered cocktail ingredient, paired with nut and cheese courses, as a
                dessert all on its own or as the perfect nightcap alongside fine cigars.

                is the resurrection of the men’s cardigan. No longer is it relegated to the realm of
                stuffy academia; the ultra-chic Gucci cardigan comes in many forms – from pared-back
                wool designs to pattern-forward statement pieces – and slots seamlessly into your
                rotation thanks to the moment’s predilection for layering.
