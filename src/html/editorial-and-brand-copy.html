            <h2>AXEL ARIGATO</h2>
            <p>
                Axel Arigato was launched with one core goal: to embrace the now while always
                searching for the tomorrow. Founders Max Svärda and Albin Johansson made their mark
                on the industry by questioning its entire structure and reinventing it to deliver
                couture-quality footwear at an affordable price tag. Expanding to include
                accessories and streetwear staples, the brand forgoes the typical seasonal
                collections and traditional sales channels in lieu of engaging with customers
                directly and releasing a new style every week. The Axel Arigato world is made up of
                references to music, art and architecture illustrated and channelled through its own
                unique, disruptive and counter-cultural voice. The result is easy-to-wear designs
                that are graphic, editorial and subtle.

                Jo Malone London weaves stories of British landscapes in perfumery. From the
                dramatic cliffs of Dover to the picturesque Cotswolds, its fragrances demonstrate a
                singular dedication to the label’s heritage and the endless fount of inspiration
                that it provides. English Pear &amp; Freesia, for example, mirrors the golden spell
                that falls over the countryside in autumn, while the Amber &amp; Lavender cologne
                evokes the cosmopolitan gardens of the capital.

                Christmas trees just aren’t complete until they’ve been crowned with a tree topper.
                The tradition captured merrymakers’ imaginations in the mid-1800s when an
                illustration of Queen Victoria, Prince Albert and the royal family gathered around
                their angel-topped Christmas tree appeared in the Illustrated London News. Angel and
                star designs have since been favoured for their connection to the Nativity, while
                glass renditions are perfect for finishing off contemporary firs.

                from fruit to bottle, exemplifying the excellence of the label’s three Californian
                vineyards: Tench, Sugarloaf Mountain and Edcora. The unique elevations, climates and
                soils of each works a near-alchemical magic upon their native grapes to create wines
                marked by intense flavours, sumptuous textures and fully realised personalities. It
                is in this way that the collective of successful entrepreneurs and gifted
                professionals at PerUs translates its central philosophy: an enriched life is
                measured not in possessions, but in the vibrant experiences shared with friends and
                family.

                stuffy academia; the ultra-chic Gucci cardigan comes in many forms – from pared-back
                wool designs to pattern-forward statement pieces – and slots seamlessly into your

                expert craftsmen. The company gets its name from the Roman numeral VI, representing
                the six coils in each of its individually pocketed springs – a brand signature since
                its founding. From the lavish first-class cabins aboard the Mauritania and RMS

                ounce of the care that has earned it a place in the rooms of the rich, famous and

            <p>
                Qasimi centres around the idea of the urban nomad, as its founder Khalid Qasimi
                translates his own life’s journey into the pillars upon which the brand is built:
                architecture, colour, military and messaging. Growing up during the Gulf War in a
                historically conflict-rife region – before relocating to the UK at age nine – lends
                his designs their military influences. He channels his Middle Eastern roots into
                deft and delicate explorations of sociopolitical subjects throughout his
                collections, earning him accolades at London and Paris Fashion Weeks. This sense of
                cultural dialogue and exchange is not literal, but instead can be admired in the
                details of the clothes, including the choice of fabrics, mood and proportions.
                Discovering his true calling for fashion design while earning a degree in
                Architectural Studies greatly informs his approach to design, as he thinks of the
                body as a landscape upon which garments are built – bringing even more meaning to
                the brand’s philosophy: clothes are to be lived in. Presented in a sophisticated yet
                subdued colour palette, this all culminates in London-based Qasimi’s unique and
                fresh perspective with worldwide appeal.

            <h2>GRLFRND</h2>
            <p>
                GRLFRND, Revolve’s debut denim label, combines vintage inspirations, modern
                tailoring and a major dose of attitude to create its highly covetable jeans. Since
                their unveiling at the brand’s members-only store in West Hollywood, the LA-made
                designs have been spotted on fashion’s most prominent influencers and tastemakers.
                The designs look and feel like heirloom denim with their premium constructions and
                authentic washes, but flatter the female form like never before. Styles including
                the wide-leg Campbell, the straight-leg Helena and the high-rise Cindy pay homage to
                the ‘90s supermodels they’re named for, while designs like the super-stretch skinny
                Kendall nod to contemporary icons. This fresh approach to high-end denim is the key
                to GRLFRND’s confidence-boosting and enviable creations.

            <p>
                Gucci’s House codes are some of the most coveted in the designer landscape, so much
                so that accessories like its card holders are a veritable requirement for

                organising essentials a luxurious affair by hosting iconic monogram motifs like the

            <h2>PROSECCO &amp; SPARKLING WINE</h2>
            <p>
                <i>Pop, fizz, clink, ahhh</i> — that’s the unmistakable sound of celebration. Adding
                a splash of our curated selection of luxury Prosecco and sparkling wines is the
                perfect way to mark life’s most momentous occasions or simply infuse effervescence
                into the everyday. The bubbly tipples delight straight from the bottle or when
                topping cocktails. It isn’t a proper party without a little something sparkly, so go
                ahead; raise a glass to splendour.

            <h2>WOMENS MONCLER COATS</h2>
            <p>
                Alpine scenes marked by the swish of skis, breathtaking peaks and fresh-fallen snow
                would not be complete without Moncler’s iconic coats. The French label cut its teeth
                crafting outerwear for the most discerning athletes and explorers, but is now
                favoured by the fashionable for its longline puffer coats, fur-trimmed down parkas
                and hooded jackets that are just as likely to be seen traversing city streets as
                they are the slopes.

            <p>
                Villeroy &amp; Boch completes your table settings with the same care and attention
                as it grants its signature porcelain creations through glassware. Crafted in crystal
                glass for a captivating element of transparency, decanters pour into white and red
                wine glasses as they mingle at festive dinner parties, its champagne flutes raise in
                effervescent celebration with pride and whisky tumblers clink at end of the evening
                as part of a savoured nightcap.
