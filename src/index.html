                    Creativity is a muscle, not a specified skillset, and an adept copywriter flexes
                    that muscle to seamlessly meet the needs of a brand or client. In my work, I
                    have had to write compelling copy for the everyday brands of American flash-sale
                    retailer Zulily to the luxury brands of the renowned London department store
                    Harrods and everything in between. Use the categories below to explore facets of
                    my previous work that might correspond to the tone of voice that you’re looking
                    for.

                <h3>In the workplace</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m known for my boundless creativity, approaching everything I do with a fresh
                    perspective while seamlessly adapting to varied customers and brand voices and
                    incorporating SEO keywords. I pride myself on making an impact on every team I
                    am a part of, not just with my writing but also through process improvement,
                    training document and workshop creation and interdepartmental partnerships
                    (check out some of these projects <a href="#projects">here</a>). I cherish the
                    meaningful, lasting relationships that I have built with the people that I’ve
                    worked alongside at every step of my career.
                </p>

                <h3>Outside of the workplace</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free time, you can find me road tripping with my other half, skipping off
                    to the theatre, and drawing Harry Potter characters as dogs.

                    I’ve been fortunate in my career to work alongside some amazing people who have
                    graciously said the following about me.
