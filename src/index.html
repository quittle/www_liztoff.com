                    Creativity is a muscle, not a specified skillset, and an adept copywriter flexes
                    that muscle to seamlessly meet the needs of a brand or client. In my work, I
                    have had to write compelling copy for the everyday brands of American flash-sale
                    retailer Zulily to the luxury brands of the renowned London department store
                    Harrods and everything in between. Use the categories below to explore facets of
                    my previous work that might correspond to the tone of voice that you’re looking
                    for.

                    Your little one and Jellycat’s Vivacious Vegetable Pea will be like, well – two
                    peas in a pod! An embroidered face smiles out of its velvety soft pod while
                    tactile twisting tendrils extend out of its ends, making it easier than ever to
                    get them to love their veggies.

                    Minimalist Scandinavian design meets new-parent practicality in the SnüzKot from
                    Snüz, with a sleek frame that transforms and grows with your little one. Set the
                    mattress at the highest position to easily reach newborns and progressively move
                    it to the two lower positions to keep mischievous toddlers in bed at night. As
                    they get older, the safety railings can be removed from the ombré beechwood
                    design, converting to a bed for children up to four years old.

                <h3>In the workplace</h3>
                <p>
                    I’m known for my boundless creativity, approaching everything I do with a fresh
                    perspective while seamlessly adapting to varied customers and brand voices and
                    incorporating SEO keywords. I pride myself on making an impact on every team I
                    am a part of, not just with my writing but also through process improvement,
                    training document and workshop creation and interdepartmental partnerships
                    (check out some of these projects <a href="#projects">here</a>). I cherish the
                    meaningful, lasting relationships that I have built with the people that I’ve
                    worked alongside at every step of my career.
                </p>

                <h3>Outside of the workplace</h3>
                <p>
                    In my free time, you can find me road tripping with my other half, skipping off
                    to the theatre, and drawing Harry Potter characters as dogs.
